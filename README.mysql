Configure MariaDB / MySQL for ownCloud
======================================

To use MariaDB / MySQL as database backend, you need to do the following:

1. Make sure that your mysql service is configured and running properly. If this
   is a fresh install, you will need to run "systemctl enable mysqld.service;
   systemctl start mysqld.service" (or mariadb.service) as root. It's also
   strongly advised to run "mysql_secure_installation" after starting the
   database for the first time.

2. Log in to the database as privileged user to create the database and a
   dedicated user account for ownCloud:
   $ mysql -u root -p
     CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
     CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS nextcloud;
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   Choose identifier and password accordingly.

Now you can launch the ownCloud setup screen, select MySQL in the advanced
settings and fill in your credentials.
